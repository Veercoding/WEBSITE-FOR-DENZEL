                <h2>Star credit limited</h2>
                <p>Star Credit Limited is a Microfinance Institution in Western Kenya Region with Head Office in Kisumu City on the shores of Lake Victoria bordering South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. It provides financial and other related support services to entrepreneurs (individuals, groups and companies) in the rural and peri-urban areas that are socio-economically marginalized.  Star Credit Limited is predominantly rural focused and based institution where challenges such as poor or near no infrastructure systems, low literacy levels and general poor economic not only remain low but untapped as well.  The institution focuses on the low income members and entrepreneurs in the rural and peri-urban areas especially Women and Youth in Western Kenya region with plans to serve entire country.  

                    The communities are faced with a number of problems.  The most prevalent and highly prioritized ones are poverty, disease, ignorance, lack of clean water, poor infrastructure as well as lack of access to effective and reliable financial products and services.  Experience has shown that the best intervention is economic empowerment through the provision of financial products and services to these member segments of the society.  Star Credit in collaboration with its partners has designed financial products that address the problems of wealth creation, diseases management, gender empowerment and youth development in the communities.  Of course there are other microfinance institutions operating in this region, however very few of them have the institutional capacity and will to reach the very rural areas of this region.  Moreover the majority of the MFIs are concentrating in micro-businesses which only contribute a small percentage to the overall development in the region.  Star Credit concentrates on those activities which have a direct influence on wealth creation and puts the rural person at the centre of economic activities.
